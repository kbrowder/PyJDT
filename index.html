        <p>=Overview=
This plugin connects classpaths listed in Eclipse's Java Development Tools (JDT) Build Path to PyDev paths.<br>
That is to say that things listed as Source, Libraries (no variable support yet though), and Projects will be placed into the PYTHONPATH before
your run code.  This is particularly useful when using Jython with Java libraries like JUnit as configured through Eclipse without having to do explicit pathing, 
it should even work with m2e.</p>

<p>It currently provides a user interface such that users may select which paths they'd like.
It's automatically enabled on projects with both PyDev and JDT natures.</p>

<p>We use the "[<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1988084&amp;group_id=85796&amp;atid=577329">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1988084&amp;group_id=85796&amp;atid=577329</a> New pythonpath contribution extension point]" 
to modify the Python Paths in addition to inspecting IClasspathEntries in the project.</p>

<p>=Known Issues=</p>

<ul>
<li>No way of seeing the generated path.</li>
<li>No support for CPE_VARIABLE entries</li>
<li>Limited testing
** very few unittests</li>
<li>No good way of running Python/Jython inside the JDT output directory.</li>
