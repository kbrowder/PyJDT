{"name":"Pyjdt","body":"=Overview=\r\nThis plugin connects classpaths listed in Eclipse's Java Development Tools (JDT) Build Path to PyDev paths.  \r\nThat is to say that things listed as Source, Libraries (no variable support yet though), and Projects will be placed into the PYTHONPATH before\r\nyour run code.  This is particularly useful when using Jython with Java libraries like JUnit as configured through Eclipse without having to do explicit pathing, \r\nit should even work with m2e.\r\n\r\nIt currently provides a user interface such that users may select which paths they'd like.\r\nIt's automatically enabled on projects with both PyDev and JDT natures.\r\n\r\nWe use the \"[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1988084&group_id=85796&atid=577329 New pythonpath contribution extension point]\" \r\nto modify the Python Paths in addition to inspecting IClasspathEntries in the project.\r\n\r\n=Known Issues=\r\n* No way of seeing the generated path.\r\n* No support for CPE_VARIABLE entries\r\n* Limited testing\r\n** very few unittests\r\n* No good way of running Python/Jython inside the JDT output directory.\r\n\r\n=License=\r\n<pre>\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
